# Day 1 mainly deals about what are variables, how to print string into the console, how to get input from the user and finally how to do concatenation.

#Input:
Prints a strings into the console, and asks the user for a string input
Example: input("How are you? ")

Variables:
A variable give a name to a piece of data. Like a box with a label, it tells you what's inside the box.
Example: myPlace = "London"     #"London" is a string and it is surrounded by double quotes

Concatenation:
We can add strings to a string to create a new string. This is called string concatenation
print("Hello"+"Mike")  => HelloMike -This is the new string
